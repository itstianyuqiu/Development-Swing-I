		// other regions. So what we'll do is add our canvas to the center (so
		// resizing the screen resizes the canvas) and our controls will have
		// a fixed size on the left (WEST).

		// specify sizes for all the components within, and then let JVM do
		// the layout and figure out how big the frame needs to be to fit. We
		// can trigger this using the pack() method, which you may see in some
		// of the other exercises.
